Project: Task Workflow

Tasks:
1) Data Gathering
2) Processing
3) Conclusion

Commit Strategy:
- Separate each task into individual commits for better tracking and clarity.
  1. First commit for data gathering.
  2. Second commit for processing.
  3. Third commit for conclusion.

Reasoning:
- Enhances traceability and accountability for each task.
- Facilitates easier review and debugging by isolating changes to specific components.
- Allows for easier collaboration, as team members can focus on specific areas.
- Enables more straightforward identification of the effects of changes on the overall project.
